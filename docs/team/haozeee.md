### Project: PlannerMD

PlannerMD is an all-in-one desktop application to help clinic receptionists manage patients and appointments in a clinic. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
